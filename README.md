# NLP-JobSpec
Training models for JobSpecs of executive roles - CEO, COO, CTO, VP, MD

## Introduction
As I apply for executive jobs, I thought I would train an NLP model on the Job Specs I want to apply for. 
I did try and use some online tools like www.jobscan.co however I found that the keywords that they selected from the job spec were not the greatest.

## Tools used
WebAnno - Java based annoation tool where I can create a project and upload the job specs and highlight key words
Spacy - Python based library for a Natural Language Processor that can also train a model

## Notes
